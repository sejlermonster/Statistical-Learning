# Statistical-Learning

Working with exercises from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning - with Applications in R" ( http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). The book uses R but I have chosen to use Python to implement the exercises.

The naming of the exercises are Lab<LabNumber> where lab number is given from the book. The lab numbers from the book is given in the format <chapter>.<section>.<LabCounter>. So if you are interested in specific topics then look at what the chapter contains to find relevant exercises.

So far i have implemented exercises from the following chapters:

Lab 3.Linear Regresioin
lab 4.Logistic regression
lab 5. Resampling methods
Lab 6 Linear Model Selection and Regularization
